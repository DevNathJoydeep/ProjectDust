					Dearest friends,
					<br /><br />
					Where do I even begin?
					<br /><br />
					Though it seems like yesterday, three years have passed since I enrolled myself into CS&E course and I cannot begin to tell you how much amazed I am due to all that has happened between then and now. Truth to be told, I took this course thinking I'd become a software developer. But two years ago, I tried my hands at web development. I learned a bit of HTML5 and CSS3 and then there was no going back.
					<br /><br />
					This website is just one of my weekend projects that blew out of proportions. I never expected to make it available to the public, let alone create an Android app for it, which I affectionately titled Project Dust. I cannot thank my brother <a href="https://twitter.com/rajdeepdevnath" target="_blank"><span class="link">@rajdeepdevnath</span></a> enough for the project logo. So far, I've received many positive reviews about this website and it has captivated me a bit. It's an overwhelming, invigorating feeling that can't even be put into words.
					<br /><br />
					I've been quite a busy bee this summer, working on <a href="http://www.projectmeteor.dx.am" target="_blank"><span class="link">Project Meteor</span></a> - my final year project. I sit on my laptop all day long, working like a mad scientist. Things are coming together nicely but there's still a lot of work that needs to be done.
					<br /><br />
					In case you want to get in touch, you can reach me out on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/joydeepdevnath" target="_blank"><span class="link">@joydeepdevnath</span></a>. I don't really have a Facebook account. I know it sounds weird, but that is how I am. This is who I am.
					<br /><br />
					With all due respect,
					<br /><br />
					Joydeep Dev Nath
